The Analysis of US College and University Tuition (R project)

Mohsen Bahremani, Lianghao Chen 

We analyzed the relationship of tuition of college and university in US, thusly generating models by statistical methods. More importantly, we finally figured out whether the model in the methods learned is the best in this project.
These years, the tuition of university in Canada has been increasing overwhelmingly. However, the factor to cause expensive tuition is not comprehensive. The data we used in this project is original from the college and university in US. The article “Average Cost of College in America”, according to data from the College Board, clearly describes the overall situation over the past 10 years. Western states had the highest public two-year and four-year tuition increase over 10 years, increasing 62% and 60% respectively. Meanwhile, public two-year and four-year colleges in the Midwest only increased by 22% and 21% within the past 10 years. The project could help to understand the reason why the out-of-state tuition increases in US are different.
